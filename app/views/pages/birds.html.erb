    Mole Valley is home to a wide range of bird species, many of which favour
    particular habitats. Some of these are highlighted below:
  </p>

  <h2>River Mole</h2>

  <p>
    Kingfishers can be seen along the length of the river â€“ a flash of blue and
    orange flying swiftly past. Grey wagtails are also common often seen around
    the Leatherhead Town Bridge and in Winter goosanders can be seen swimming
    along the river.
  </p>

  <h2>Ponds and streams</h2>

  <p>
    Many common birds can be seen on our ponds and streams including mallards,
    coots, moorhens, Canada geese, greylag geese and grey wagtails.
  </p>

  <h2>Farmland</h2>

  <p>
    There is a range of birds found in our farmland habitat including game birds
    such as pheasants and red-legged partridge. In the hedgerows you can see
    yellowhammers and finches and feeding in the fields there are often skylarks
    and thrushes; in the Winter the song and mistle thrushes are joined by
    redwings and fieldfares from Scandinavia.
  </p>

  <h2>Woodland</h2>

  <p>
    Our woodland areas host a wide variety of birds including 5 species of tit
    (blue, great, coal, long-tailed and marsh), great spotted woodpeckers,
    redpolls and siskins.
  </p>

  <h2>Urban parks, green spaces and gardens</h2>

  <p>
    Another rich environment for several species of birds which include:
    green woodpeckers, robins, blackbirds, tits, pied wagtails and many more.
  </p>

  <h2>Commons and Heaths</h2>

  <p>
    Our commons and heathlands are home all year round to birds such as finches
    and tits. Rarer summer migrants include woodlarks (Headley Heath),
    nightingales and warblers (Bookham Common). Arguably the most important
    bird site in Mole Valley is Bookham Common for nightingales.
